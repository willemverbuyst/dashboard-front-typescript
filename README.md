# Dashboard

## What is this?

This is the TypeScript version of the dashboard (front-end section) project I made during my bootcamp at Codaisseur.

For the details on that project, have a look [here](https://github.com/willemverbuyst/school-dashboard-frontend).

## Why?

As I wanted to learn TypeScript, I felt that revisiting the project would be a great starting point. I would have to implement TypeScript in a bigger project and meanwhile I could re-evaluate the code that I had written for this project.
